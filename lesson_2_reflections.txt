What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do we need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository, git create a hidden .git directory.
	We need to do this so that git can place all necessary data it uses 
	to manage this folder.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is where you let git know what you want to place in the repository.
	The working directory can have files not required to be placed in the repository, such
	as temporary files.  The staging area thus provides an intermediate location between
	the respository and the working directory.
