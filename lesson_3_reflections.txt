When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    You would want to do this when you would like to share your work with others and when
    you want to work on your code collaboratively.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	1. You don't want remote changes to overwrite something that you are working on
	2. You can work offline without the stupid PC constantly checking the remote repository
