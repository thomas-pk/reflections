How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It allowed me to see what changes were introduced in the file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It allows me to understand who did what changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You can decide when to do a commit.  Cons: You may forget to do a commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because the functionality that require the changes may affect multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log provides you a log of all changes while git diff provides differences 
	between two versions of commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
